                <b>Overview:</b><br>
               A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.
               Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer.
               Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
               The earliest known programmable machine that preceded the invention of the digital computer was the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age.
               From the early 1800s, "programs" were used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms and player pianos.
               Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computer field, and many more still are being created every year.
               Many programming languages require computation to be specified in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other 
               languages use other forms of program specification such as the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).
